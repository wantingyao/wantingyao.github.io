Hi there!

I'm a first-year robotics master student in [GRASP Lab](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/) at University of Pennsylvania. Previously, I worked with [Prof. Yanchao Yang](https://yanchaoyang.github.io/) at University of Hong Kong as an undergrad research intern. I received my Bachelor's degree in Automation with the honor of "Outstanding Graduate" from Zhejiang University in 2025.

My research interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics, with an emphasis on developing autonomy and intelligence in robots and enhancing their ability to perceive and interpret the surrounding environment. Specifically, I am interested in robotic perception and manipulation, aiming to develop a vision representation system with spatial reasoning capabilities to improve robots' performance in manipulation tasks.
